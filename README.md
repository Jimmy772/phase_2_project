* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter

## Project Description
In this section, we will provide a more detailed overview of our data science project, focusing on data sources, research questions, analysis techniques, and challenges encountered.

### Data Scources:
Our primary data source is the Kings County House Sales dataset, which includes information on various attributes of houses sold in the area. This dataset provides us with valuable insights into the housing market, allowing us to explore relationships between house features and sale prices.

### Research Questions:
Our research questions are:
1. How do different attributes of a house, such as size, condition, and location, affect its sale price?
2. Can we identify specific renovations that have a significant positive impact on a home's value?

### Data Analysis and Visualization:
To answer these questions, we will conduct extensive data analysis and visualization techniques. We will explore the relationships between the independent variables (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition) and the dependent variable (sale price) using statistical measures and visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps. This analysis will help us identify patterns, outliers, and potential areas for further investigation.

### Modeling Approach:
For estimating home values and predicting the impact of renovations, we will utilize multiple linear regression modeling techniques. By incorporating relevant independent variables and building regression models, we aim to develop a robust framework for estimating the value of a house based on its attributes and identifying which renovations are likely to yield the highest return on investment.

### Blockers and Challenges:
During the project, we may face several challenges, including missing or incomplete data, outliers, and the need to handle categorical variables effectively. We will employ appropriate data preprocessing techniques, such as data imputation, outlier removal, and encoding categorical variables, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our models.

By addressing these challenges and conducting comprehensive data analysis and modeling, our project aims to provide valuable insights to the real estate agency and assist homeowners in making informed decisions regarding home renovations and maximizing their property values.
